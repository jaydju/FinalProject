myTC Scheduler Patch 1.00 2018
Hello! Thanks for using myTC Scheduler - A Better Way to Visualize your Schedule and Availabilities!

This program was built as a final project for MSTU 4031 - Object Oriented Programming 
at Teachers College, Columbia University.

The first iteration, while achieving its intended purpose, contains much room for
improvement. Reinserted user input in the text areas layers the visualizations on top of the previous execution. 
Thus, version 1.00 works best re-running the program per each visualization. 
Patch Notes is currently user-editable (try it out yourself). 
TBA and missing class information are handled but is not perfect and fails to work in some instances. 

Future Updates:
Aside from these bugs, features we plan on adding include dynamic visualization of availabilities for every combination 
of individuals thereby seeing the cross-sectional availabilities within members of the group. 

Enjoy!
